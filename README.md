# Sandeep-HCLFinal

This contains code for Creating the code Data.csv
(in codeforinput.ipynb and push.py for pusing it in a csv file)

The app.py consist of code for taking input from the user and checking it with the key.csv and comparing it Coursera.csv and TF-IDF will transform the text into meaningful representation of integers or numbers which is used to fit machine learning algorithm for predictions.

TF-IDF Vectorizer is a measure of originality of a word by comparing the number of times a word appears in document with the number of documents the word appears in. formula for TF-IDF is:

TF-IDF = TF(t, d) x IDF(t), where, TF(t, d) = Number of times term "t" appears in a document "d". IDF(t) = Inverse document frequency of the term t.

The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.

Cosine Similarity is used for comparision of the Normalised TF-IDF and Normalised key input value.

The Web server is hosted using Flask Webserver and HTML along with CSS is used for the Webpage that is built into this.


Note: ADD the CSS files in Folder named static and HTML in templetes folder.
